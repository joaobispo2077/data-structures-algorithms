Tree is a structure that represents a tree, like this:
```md
       A
     / | \
    B  G  C
    / \    \
    D  E    F
```md

In these tree, we have some concepts:
- A is the root of the tree.
- All elements are nodes.
- A node can have 0 or more children.
- Nodes without children are leaves.
- A node can be a tree, a node inside a tree is a subtree.
- Two or more trees form a forest.
- E is descendant of A.
- A is an ancestor of E.

Binary Tree:

```md
       A
      /  \
      B   C
     / \  / \
    D  E  G  F
    \       /
     H     I
```md

A binary tree is a tree with some rules:
- A node can have at most 2 children.
